<h2>Required libraries</h2>
PIP is a package management system used to install and manage software packages/libraries written in Python.   

```
pip install requests
```

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your ```PUT``` & ```POST``` data — but nowadays, just use the ```json``` method!

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for ```iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree```.

```
pip install bs4
```
This is a dummy package managed by the developer of Beautiful Soup to prevent name squatting. The official name of PyPI’s Beautiful Soup Python package is beautifulsoup4. This package ensures that if you type ```pip install bs4``` by mistake you will end up with Beautiful Soup
